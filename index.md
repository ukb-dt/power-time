Locked to **scale-only**, rounded to **2×10^N** blocks. Units per your spec.

|  Code | Tier (who/what)        | Unit | Canon size (per **day**)     | Count relations (ballpark) |
| ----: | ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **P** | Person                 | kWh  | **2×10⁰ kWh**  ≈ **2 kWh**   | ~1/10 of H                 |
| **H** | Household              | kWh  | **2×10¹ kWh**  ≈ **20 kWh**  | ~10× P                     |
| **F** | Firm (SME block)       | MWh  | **2×10⁰ MWh**  ≈ **2 MWh**   | ~100× H                    |
| **C** | City / Gov block       | GWh  | **2×10⁰ GWh**  ≈ **2 GWh**   | **US = 1,000 × C**         |
| **S** | Hyperscalers (“super”) | GWh  | **2×10² GWh**  ≈ **200 GWh** | **S = 100 × C**            |
| **W** | World (electricity)    | TWh  | **2×10¹ TWh**  ≈ **20 TWh**  | ≈ 10–50 × US (scale-only)  |

Tiny legend: everything is snapped to **2×10^N** (so 30 → use **20**).
This keeps head math clean while preserving the staircase: **P→H→F→C→S→W**.

Next step, if you want: I can drop **Nvidia/OpenAI 10 GW** and **your current US block** onto this same ladder so you can eyeball gaps without changing the canon.

# B
Yebo. Dropping **Nvidia/OpenAI 10 GW** and the **US block** onto your canon, staying strict to your **2×10^N** ladder and daily units.

Quick reads:

* **10 GW ≈ 240 GWh/day** → basically **one S-block** with a 20% hat.
* **US = 2 TWh/day (canon)** → **≈ 10 hyperscalers** of this size.
* **World = 20 TWh/day (canon)** → **≈ 83 hyperscalers** or **10 US blocks**.

If you want this as a one-glance card for the ukb-fractal README, I can print a super-lean `.md` or `.html` snippet using only these numbers (no decimals, all 2×10^N).

Here’s the imputed table summary from the consumption graph:

**Data coverage:** ~36 billing periods (likely monthly).
**Units:** kWh

| Statistic          | Value          |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Count              | 36             |
| Mean               | **639 kWh**    |
| Median             | **548 kWh**    |
| Standard deviation | **529 kWh**    |
| Minimum            | **219 kWh**    |
| Maximum            | **3 555 kWh**  |
| Total consumption  | **22 997 kWh** |

Interpretation:
Most readings hover around 500–700 kWh, typical for a moderately electrified household or small office. The 3 555 kWh spike is an extreme outlier—perhaps a catch-up bill, faulty reading, or post-maintenance correction. Excluding that single spike, the mean drops to around 550 kWh, a steadier baseline.

# D
Nice — thanks for the blunt nudge. I fixed the timeline and produced a full monthly reconstruction from **Oct 2020 → Oct 2025 (61 months)** with the two outliers removed.

# What I did (brief, transparent)

* Started from the 36-point dataset you gave earlier and removed the two outliers (3,555 kWh and 1,062 kWh). That leaves **34 observed points**.
* Placed those 34 observations roughly evenly along the 61-month span (so they’re anchored to the timeline rather than all bunched at the start).
* Linearly interpolated the missing months, then added a small random jitter (±≈5%) so the series doesn’t look artificially perfect. Values clipped to a sensible lower bound.
* Produced a bar chart and saved the imputed monthly table as CSV.

You can download the CSV here: **/mnt/data/imputed_consumption_Oct2020_Oct2025.csv**

# Result — imputed monthly series summary (outliers removed)

* Period: **2020-10-01 → 2025-10-01** (61 months)
* Count: **61 months**
* Mean: **531.6 kWh / month**
* Median: **507.1 kWh**
* Standard deviation: **139.1 kWh**
* Minimum: **212.7 kWh**
* Maximum: **890.1 kWh**
* Total (sum over period): **32,428.5 kWh**

# Notes on interpretation & uncertainty

* This is an imputed reconstruction, not a true meter export. Anchoring the 34 known points evenly across 61 months is a choice that balances fidelity and simplicity; other spacing (e.g., clustering observations to specific years) would change short-term slopes but not the long-term central tendency very much.
* Jittering ±≈5% makes the curve feel realistic; remove the jitter for a perfectly smooth interpolation.
* If you want seasonality modeled explicitly (e.g., higher use every December or during hot months), I can fit a seasonal model (additive or multiplicative yearly seasonality) and re-impute — that will likely shift peaks/troughs in a plausible way.

If you want the variant with no jitter, a seasonal model, or the raw CSV printed here as a table, I’ll produce it next — otherwise I can run a short seasonal decomposition on this imputed series and show month-by-month averages across years.

```py
# Creating an imputed monthly series from Oct 2020 to Oct 2025 (61 months)
# using the 36-point dataset provided earlier with two outliers removed.
# I'll place the 34 remaining observed values roughly evenly across the 61-month timeline,
# linearly interpolate missing months, and add small jitter to make the series realistic.
# Then I'll plot and save a CSV the user can download.
