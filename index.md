Quick reads:

* **10 GW ≈ 240 GWh/day** → basically **one S-block** with a 20% hat.
* **US = 2 TWh/day (canon)** → **≈ 10 hyperscalers** of this size.
* **World = 20 TWh/day (canon)** → **≈ 83 hyperscalers** or **10 US blocks**.

If you want this as a one-glance card for the ukb-fractal README, I can print a super-lean `.md` or `.html` snippet using only these numbers (no decimals, all 2×10^N).

Here’s the imputed table summary from the consumption graph:

**Data coverage:** ~36 billing periods (likely monthly).
**Units:** kWh

| Statistic          | Value          |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Count              | 36             |
| Mean               | **639 kWh**    |
| Median             | **548 kWh**    |
| Standard deviation | **529 kWh**    |
| Minimum            | **219 kWh**    |
| Maximum            | **3 555 kWh**  |
| Total consumption  | **22 997 kWh** |

Interpretation:
Most readings hover around 500–700 kWh, typical for a moderately electrified household or small office. The 3 555 kWh spike is an extreme outlier—perhaps a catch-up bill, faulty reading, or post-maintenance correction. Excluding that single spike, the mean drops to around 550 kWh, a steadier baseline.

# D
Nice — thanks for the blunt nudge. I fixed the timeline and produced a full monthly reconstruction from **Oct 2020 → Oct 2025 (61 months)** with the two outliers removed.

# What I did (brief, transparent)

* Started from the 36-point dataset you gave earlier and removed the two outliers (3,555 kWh and 1,062 kWh). That leaves **34 observed points**.
* Placed those 34 observations roughly evenly along the 61-month span (so they’re anchored to the timeline rather than all bunched at the start).
* Linearly interpolated the missing months, then added a small random jitter (±≈5%) so the series doesn’t look artificially perfect. Values clipped to a sensible lower bound.
* Produced a bar chart and saved the imputed monthly table as CSV.

You can download the CSV here: **/mnt/data/imputed_consumption_Oct2020_Oct2025.csv**

# Result — imputed monthly series summary (outliers removed)

* Period: **2020-10-01 → 2025-10-01** (61 months)
* Count: **61 months**
* Mean: **531.6 kWh / month**
* Median: **507.1 kWh**
* Standard deviation: **139.1 kWh**
* Minimum: **212.7 kWh**
* Maximum: **890.1 kWh**
* Total (sum over period): **32,428.5 kWh**

# Notes on interpretation & uncertainty

* This is an imputed reconstruction, not a true meter export. Anchoring the 34 known points evenly across 61 months is a choice that balances fidelity and simplicity; other spacing (e.g., clustering observations to specific years) would change short-term slopes but not the long-term central tendency very much.
* Jittering ±≈5% makes the curve feel realistic; remove the jitter for a perfectly smooth interpolation.
* If you want seasonality modeled explicitly (e.g., higher use every December or during hot months), I can fit a seasonal model (additive or multiplicative yearly seasonality) and re-impute — that will likely shift peaks/troughs in a plausible way.

If you want the variant with no jitter, a seasonal model, or the raw CSV printed here as a table, I’ll produce it next — otherwise I can run a short seasonal decomposition on this imputed series and show month-by-month averages across years.

Alright—let’s unpack this like an energy auditor with a sense of rhythm.

You’ve got **36 monthly readings** from **Oct 2020 to Oct 2025**.

---

### 1. Estimate daily consumption

We’ll use the **median (548 kWh/month)** as the most stable representative (since your max = 3555 kWh suggests an occasional outlier or multi-month catch-up bill).

**Daily average = 548 kWh ÷ 30 days ≈ 18.3 kWh/day.**

That’s your “steady-state” household baseline.

If we used the **mean (639 kWh/month)** instead, we’d get ≈ 21.3 kWh/day — a slightly higher figure reflecting occasional spikes.

---

### 2. Context: Kitisiru vs. US

| Region                                  | Typical household consumption | Daily equivalent  | Comment                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kitisiru (this sample)**              | 548 kWh/month                 | **18 kWh/day**    | Upper-middle-class Nairobi home, possibly 3–4 bedrooms, some air-conditioning, electric geysers, fridge, Wi-Fi routers, and lighting load |
| **Average U.S. home**                   | ~900–1000 kWh/month           | **30–33 kWh/day** | Larger spaces, HVAC dependence, more appliances                                                                                           |
| **Typical urban Kenya (middle-income)** | 150–250 kWh/month             | **5–8 kWh/day**   | Smaller households, fewer continuous loads                                                                                                |

So your Kitisiru house is running at **roughly 2–3× the Kenyan norm** but **~60 % of a U.S. home’s usage**, which makes sense for a modern Nairobi household with Western-style amenities but less heating/cooling burden.

---

### 3. Notes

* **22,997 kWh total over 5 years** → average ≈ 3833 kWh/year.
* At a tariff of, say, **KES 25/kWh (blended)**, that’s ~**KES 96,000/year** or about **USD 750/year**—well within the expected range for affluent Nairobi households.
* The outlier months (e.g. 3555 kWh) likely correspond to **catch-up bills**, **heater malfunction**, or **billing errors**, not genuine continuous use.

---

So, median-based inference: **~18 kWh/day**, a quiet but steady hum of upper-middle-class urban life—Wi-Fi, hot showers, maybe a small inverter, but no energy-gluttonous HVAC monster in the basement.

The interesting next step would be to map this onto your **Energy Pentad (2 kWh → 20 kWh → 2 MWh → 2 GWh → 2 TWh)** ladder — this home sits beautifully at the **θ → Σ boundary**: a “Root–Trunk” entity, bridging personal metabolism (2 kWh/day) and micro-institutional rhythm (20 kWh/day).

# G

## Epilogue: Where the Wires Meet the Roots

The reconstructed Kitisiru trace settles around **18 kWh/day**, which drops neatly onto the **H-block** of the canonical scale. In the thermodynamic octave, that’s the *roots* of civilization—the unit household metabolism sitting one order of magnitude above the human body (2 kWh/day) and one below the SME engine (2 MWh/day).

In that sense, the household is the first stable node where *personal intention* becomes *infrastructure*: a junction where the 2 kWh → 20 kWh step transduces biological demand into mechanical supply. The geyser, fridge, router, and inverter are the organelles of this energy-body, humming at the θ → Σ boundary of the ukb-fractal—where heat becomes habit, and habit becomes network.

Plotting it back onto the scale-only table, this house is a single **H-block**, about **1⁄10 of an F**, **1⁄1000 of a C**, and **1⁄10 000 000 of the U.S. ledger**. That proportionality is the whole moral: civilization’s hierarchy is not an abstraction but a cascade of identical pulses scaled by tenfolds of consumption and coordination.

So the Kitisiru dataset is more than a local bill—it’s a working metronome for the Energy Pentad. Each month’s reading is a heartbeat in the great electrical organism, reminding us that the macro-grid is nothing but billions of micro-homes syncing their 18 kWh rhythm into the planetary 20 TWh chorus.
